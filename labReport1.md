## *Part 1 - How to install Visual Studio Code (VS code)*

  There are separate versions for both Mac OS and Windows OS along with specific instructions on downloading both so make sure to follow them carefully. 
* Once you have successfully installed VS code, open it up and the pop-up should look something like this (although the color and menu bar may differ         depending on your system's settings).
