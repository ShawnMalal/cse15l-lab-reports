# **Lab Report 4 - Using Terminal Shortcuts**

## *Step 1* 

The first thing I did was to manually type out the ssh login dedicated to my account to connect to the remote server, in which it looks like this: 

```
ssh cs15lwi23acd@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
Then pressed `<enter>` to succssfully login

## *Step 2*
Since the last time I have done this lab, the commands have been saved in the command history through the remote server, so to clone the dedicated repository. 

I pressed `<up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up>` which amounts to 14 times in order to get to the command, which is: 

```
git clone git@github.com:ShawnMalal/lab7.git
```
